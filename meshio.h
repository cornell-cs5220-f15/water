/**
 * ## I/O
 * 
 * After finishing a run (or every several steps), we might want to
 * write out a data file for post processing.  One simple approach is
 * to draw a gray scale or color picture showing some scalar quantity
 * at each point.  The Portable Gray Map (PGM) format is one of the
 * few graphics formats that can be dumped out in a handful of lines
 * of code without any library calls.  The files can be converted to
 * something more modern and snazzy (like a PNG or GIF) later on.
 * Note that we don't actually dump out the state vector for each cell
 * -- we need to produce something that is an integer in the range
 * [0,255].  That's what the function `f` is for!
