\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

In this report, we explore parallelization strategies for solving the
shallow water equation. We start by profiling the naive implementation of
the code in order to identify bottlenecks as well as build our intuition
for developing a relatively accurate performance model. This information
is used to guide the parallelization of the code for both the compute
nodes (i.e., Intel Xeon E5-2620) and the accelerator boards (i.e., Intel
Xeon Phi 5110P) on the Totient cluster. We further implement and evaluate
several optimizations for tuning the parallel code.
% to achieve speedups of up to X\%.
