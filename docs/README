Automatic LaTeX Build System Template

This is a template for the Automatic LaTeX Build System. Please refer to
'albs-uguide.txt' for more information on the build system. Writers
should eventually replace this 'README' file with information on their
new project if they are going to generally distribute the LaTeX source
code. It is recommended that the new 'README' file keep a pointer to
'albs-uguide.txt'. You may also want to keep the version information
around so that you know what version of the build system you are using.
