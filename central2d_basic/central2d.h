 * # Jiang-Tadmor central difference scheme
 * 
 * [Jiang and Tadmor][jt] proposed a high-resolution finite difference
 * scheme for solving hyperbolic PDE systems in two space dimensions.
 * The method is particularly attractive because, unlike many other
 * methods in this space, it does not require that we write any
 * solvers for problems with special initial data (so-called Riemann
 * problems), nor even that we compute Jacobians of the flux
 * functions.
 * 
 * While this code is based loosely on the Fortran code at the end of
 * Jiang and Tadmor's paper, we've written the current code to be
 * physics-agnostic (rather than hardwiring it to the shallow water
 * equations -- or the Euler equations in the Jiang-Tadmor paper).
 * If you're interested in the Euler equations, feel free to add your
 * own physics class to support them!
 * 
 * [jt]: http://www.cscamm.umd.edu/tadmor/pub/central-schemes/Jiang-Tadmor.SISSC-98.pdf
 * 
 * ## Staggered grids
 * 
 * The Jiang-Tadmor scheme works by alternating between a main grid
 * and a staggered grid offset by half a step in each direction.
 * Understanding this is important, particularly if you want to apply
 * a domain decomposition method and batch time steps between
 * synchronization barriers in your parallel code!
 * 
 * In even-numbered steps, the entry `u(i,j)` in the array of solution
 * values represents the average value of a cell centered at a point
 * $(x_i,y_j)$.  At the following odd-numbered step, the same entry
 * represents values for a cell centered at $(x_i + \Delta x/2, y_j +
 * \Delta y/2)$.  However, whenever we run a simulation, we always take
 * an even number of steps, so that outside the solver we can just think
 * about values on the main grid.  If `uold` and `unew` represent the
 * information at two successive *even* time steps (i.e. they represent
 * data on the same grid), then `unew(i,j)` depends indirectly on
 * `u(p,q)` for $i-3 \leq p \leq i+3$ and $j-3 \leq q \leq j+3$.
 * 
 * We currently manage this implicitly: the arrays at even time steps
 * represent cell values on the main grid, and arrays at odd steps
 * represent cell values on the staggered grid.  Our main `run` 
 * function always takes an even number of time steps to ensure we end
 * up on the primary grid.
 * 
 * ## Interface
 * 
 * We want a clean separation between the physics, the solver,
 * and the auxiliary limiter methods used by the solver.  At the same
 * time, we don't want to pay the overhead (mostly in terms of lost
 * optimization opportunities) for calling across an abstraction
 * barrier in the inner loops of our solver.  We can get around this
 * in C++ by providing the solver with *template arguments*, resolved
 * at compile time, that describe separate classes to implement the
 * physics and the limiter.
 *
 * The `Central2D` solver class takes two template arguments:
 * `Physics` and `Limiter`.  For `Physics`, we expect the name of a class
 * that defines:
 * 
 *  - A type for numerical data (`real`)
 *  - A type for solution and flux vectors in each cell (`vec`)
 *  - A flux computation function (`flux(vec& F, vec& G, const vec& U)`)
 *  - A wave speed computation function 
 *    (`wave_speed(real& cx, real& cy, const vec& U)`).
 * 
 * The `Limiter` argument is a type with a static function `limdiff`
 * with the signature
 * 
 *         limdiff(fm, f0, fp)
 * 
 * The semantics are that `fm`, `f0`, and `fp` are three successive
 * grid points in some direction, and the function returns an approximate
 * (scaled) derivative value from these points.
 * 
 * The solver keeps arrays for the solution, flux values, derivatives
 * of the solution and the fluxes, and the solution at the next time
 * point.  We use the C++ `vector` class to manage storage for these
 * arrays; but since we want to think of them as 2D arrays, we also
 * provide convenience functions to access them with multiple indices
 * (though we maintain C-style 0-based indexing).  The internal arrays
 * are padded with ghost cells; the ghost cell in the lower left corner
 * of the domain has index (0,0).

 * the solution at the full step.  For full details, we refer to the
 * [Jiang and Tadmor paper][jt].

 * which is the time step modulo 2 (0 if even, 1 if odd); and the `dt`
 * flag, which actually determines the time step length.  We need
 * to know the even-vs-odd distinction because the Jiang-Tadmor
 * scheme alternates between a primary grid (on even steps) and a
 * staggered grid (on odd steps).  This means that the data at $(i,j)$
 * in an even step and the data at $(i,j)$ in an odd step represent
 * values at different locations in space, offset by half a space step
 * in each direction.  Every other step, we shift things back by one
 * mesh cell in each direction, essentially resetting to the primary
