Vectorization and vectorization report
C, C++ and the troubles with aliasing
Use one big array and partition in to 3 instead of 3 separate.
Do flux in one big go. Parallelize later. Same with speed!
Use assert to tell what the values are to the compiler.
Memory trimming after vectorization

Domain decomposition
    Use the same time step for few steps because the max speed may not vary by too much. Synchronize later and check.
