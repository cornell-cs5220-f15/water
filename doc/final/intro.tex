\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Structured grid computation, the fifth of the famous thirteen dwarfs, is a
ubiquitous computational pattern in high performance computing. Structured grid
computations show up in a variety of contexts including cellular automata and
fluid dynamics simulations. In this paper, we present the development of a set
of optimized shallow water simulators.

In \secref{verification}, we discuss a simple verification system we developed
to ensure the correctness of our simulators. In \secref{timing}, we explain how
we timed and evaluated our simulators. In \secref{build}, we present how we
modified the build system to increase developer productivity. In
\secref{vectorization}, \secref{parallelization}, and \secref{domaindecomp}, we
describe how we vectorized, parallelized, and domain decomposed our simulators.
In \secref{evaluation}, we evaluate our simulators.
