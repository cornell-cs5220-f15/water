Shallow water simulator for project 2

Please look at CS5220Project2.pdf, not the older CS5220Project2 (1).pdf one. I couldn't figure out how to remove it from the Git repo because I accidentally deleted it on my local repository and so can't git rm it.

Also I didn't realize that editing the README counts as a commit. Hopefully this won't be counted as a late submission because if I had known I would have just not modified the README and put it in the description instead.
